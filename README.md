# Games

This repository is a growing collection of beginner-friendly Python games built using Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Current Projects

### Tic Tac Toe (`Tic_Tac_Toe.ipynb`)

A classic two-player game adapted for a single player against a basic AI. The game includes:

- 3×3 grid-based gameplay
- Turn-based interaction in the console
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Two AI modes: first-available or random move selection
- Input validation and error handling

---

### Random Number Guessing Game (`Random_Number_Game.ipynb`)

A simple but engaging game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. Features include:

- Customizable upper limit for the random number
- User-defined number of guesses allowed
- Feedback for too-low or too-high guesses
- Handling of invalid inputs
- End-of-game feedback with the correct number revealed

## Tools Used

- Python (Standard Library only)
- `random` for number generation
- `input()` for user interaction
- `try-except` for robust input validation
